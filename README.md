# Khajiit has Books

Khajiit has Books is a book reader application for your android phone. It offers access to all books in [The Elder Scrolls](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/) series - A famous video game franchise with focus on an open world and fantasy elements. [Download APK here](https://github.com/Tibi19/khajiit-has-books/releases/download/v1.0.0-beta/khajiit-has-books.apk) 

The contents of these texts are found and represented in the games as books the main character can pick up for the player to read. The texts themselves aren't neccesarily as big as real life books, but if we were to make the conversion, they can range from short, 1 page writings to texts as long as 70, 100 or even 250 pages. The contents contain extensive descriptions of the games' lore on subjects such as history, religion, fiction, research, journals, or correspondences between characters and represent, in my humble opinion, quite a qualitative collection of literary works.

## Tech Stack

The application is made with Android Studio and the Android SDK using the following technologies:
* Kotlin
* MVI Architecture
* Jetpack Compose UI
* Room Database
* Flow and Kotlin Coroutines
* Dagger Hilt Dependency Injection
* Moshi Json Converter
* Coil Image Loading
* Python and Beautiful Soup for Web Scrapping

The contents of the books were scraped from [The Imperial Library](https://www.imperial-library.info/books/all/by-title) website using Python and Beautiful Soup scripts available in the [crawl-the-imperial-library](https://github.com/Tibi19/crawl-the-imperial-library) repository.
